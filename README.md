# DS203_Project

This was the end-term project for the course DS203: Programming for Data Science. <br>
The project which we worked on was: **Analysis of Covid-19 in India**. <br>
We used a total of 11 datasets taken from Kaggle and Wikipedia, which were cleaned suitably. The major points our project covered
are as follows:
* Performed insightful and detailed Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization of Covid-19 
in India highlighting the rural-urban divide, testing capabilities and the impact of GDP in different regions
* Created animated progression trends using Python libraries such as plotly, pandas and numpy
analysing various facets such as doubling time of cases, comparison among different states and so on
* Analysed the distribution of ICMR testing facilities in India, trends in the daily confirmed
cases, daily cured cases, daily deaths and further studied the impact of age in regards to Covid-19, comparing
India with the rest of the world in her battle against the pandemic

The cleaning and analysis codes are contained in "Cleaning.ipynb" and "Analysis.ipynb" respectively.
"DS203_Project_Report" contains a detailed report for the same.
